What is SVN-K:
SVN-K is an addon for Komodo, which integrates the IDE with TortoiseSVN.

Windows Only:
The extension will only work in Windows as this is the only platform, which
Tortoise works.  It is envisioned that some functionality might be ported to
other platforms in the future by allowing the user to specify an SVN
application. However, this will be for a later version, for the time being,
Tortoise is the main focus.

Locales:
The only locale supplied for this addon is en-US.  If you wish to write another
locale for another language, please feel free to do so.  I'd be happy to add
any other languages.
